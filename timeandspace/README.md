# Time & Space – A Personal Cyberpunk Blog

![Cyberpunk Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600/0d001a/00ffff?text=Time+and+Space+Cyberpunk+Blog)  
*(Screenshot coming soon — neon rain, glitch effects, holographic cards)*

A full-stack **MEAN** (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) personal blog application built while following Maximilian Schwarzmüller's classic Angular & Node.js course — but taken to the next level with a **custom cyberpunk aesthetic**.

This isn't just a tutorial project.  
It's a **digital sanctuary** — a neon-lit space for thoughts, experiments, and reflections on the journey of learning full-stack development.

## Features

- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete entries)
- Image upload with preview and validation
- Responsive pagination
- User authentication (signup/login with JWT)
- Protected routes (only owners can edit/delete)
- Persistent login (remembers you after refresh)
- Custom **cyberpunk theme**:
  - Neon cyan + magenta glows
  - Glitch text on hover
  - Falling digital rain background
  - Holographic glass cards
  - Pulsing buttons
  - Rajdhani + Orbitron fonts

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 21 + Angular Material
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas)
- **Styling**: SCSS with heavy custom overrides for the cyberpunk look
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens

## Live Demo

Coming soon after deployment!

## Setup & Running Locally

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/timeandspace.git
   cd timeandspace

2.  Backend:bash

Why This Project Matters

This started as a course exercise — but became a creative outlet.

Every bug fixed, every glow added, every late-night debug session is documented in the entries themselves.

It's not just code.

It's a story.

Built with passion in December 2025 by Kimah.
